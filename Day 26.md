BENEFITS OF POWER BI PREMIUM OVER PRO

Power BI Premium offers several advanced features that make it more suitable for enterprise-level reporting compared to Power BI Pro. One of the biggest advantages is that Premium provides dedicated cloud resources, which means faster report performance and no sharing of resources with other users.

With Premium, we can also work with much larger datasets, supporting up to 400 GB per dataset, whereas in Power BI Pro the limit is just 1 GB.

Another key benefit is access to paginated reports, which are not available in Pro. These reports are useful when we need to create fixed-layout reports, such as invoices or official reports.

Premium allows for more frequent data refreshes, up to 48 times per day, while Power BI Pro is limited to 8 refreshes per day.

It also includes advanced AI features, such as AutoML and cognitive services, which can help in building predictive models and enhancing reports with artificial intelligence.

Lastly, Premium makes report sharing easier within the organization. Even users without a Pro license can access reports when Premium capacity is used, making it more cost-effective for larger teams.
